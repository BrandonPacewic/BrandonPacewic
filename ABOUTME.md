My name is Brandon Pacweic and I am a 17 year old programming enthusiast.

    Notes about game development club contributions

    I was responsible for gun mechanics, health management/damage, and
    the dynamic player HUD. Me being a major code nerd stayed away from 
    animation/art design and focused on the inner functionality.
