Prompt 1 Fun With Numbers

This program takes repeated user inputs of ints, if the value of the int is 
even it is added to a total sum of all even numbers entered up to this point.
If the int is odd we count it as another odd number. At the end we output
the sum of all the even numbers, and the count of how many odd numbers were entered.
